# Human-Machine Collaborative Crisis Response Framework (HMC-CRF)
A reinforcement learning-based framework for trusted multi-agent collaboration in emergency management scenarios.

---

## üìñ Introduction
This repository implements a **Multi-Agent System (MAS)** framework for human-machine collaborative crisis response, combining **vision-language models (VL)** and **reinforcement learning (RL)** to enhance safety and reliability. The framework features:
- **Real-Time Task Execution**: Modular task chains with built-in safety rules and human oversight.
- **Simulation Training**: Experience replay library for risk prediction and optimization.
- **Dynamic Trust Mechanism**: Balances task utility and safety constraints through RL.

**Key Contributions**:
1. Dual-mode architecture (online execution + offline simulation).
2. First fine-tuned safe LLM and training dataset for emergency scenarios.
3. 15% improvement in helpfulness and 40% reduction in risk response rate compared to baseline.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HMC-CRF.git
cd HMC-CRF
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
1. **Real-Time Task Execution**:
```python
from hmc_crf import RealTimeSystem
system = RealTimeSystem(safety_rules="config/safety_rules.yaml")
system.execute_task("task_chain.json")
```

2. **Simulation Training**:
```python
from hmc_crf import SimulationSystem
simulator = SimulationSystem(dataset="data/sim_tasks.json")
simulator.train(epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

### Core Components
1. **Online Execution System**  
   - **Planning-Execution Pipeline**: Modular task chains drive tool operations.  
   - **Safety Guardrails**: Predefined rules and GPT-4-based risk assessment.  

2. **Offline Simulation System**  
   - **Task Generation**: Synthetic tasks from manual records and prior knowledge.  
   - **Experience Replay**: Optimizes RL policies for dynamic environments.
